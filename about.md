A long time ago (by internet standards) there was a website called Brotherhood of the Bean.  It was a website fuelled by coffee addicts.  Those addicts; myself (the owner), Dan Marchik (my old Army buddy) and a fellow lover of coffer named Olaf (yes, I knew an Olaf before the Frozen movie); drank coffee like there was no tomorrow and savoured writing about our experiences. 

And then, Brotherhood of the Bean was hacked, well WordPress was, and I just didn't have the energy to do much more that quarantine the entire mess.

Time passed, and even more coffee was consumed.  The lunar eclipse on 9/28/15 provided the omen I needed, Brotherhood of the Bean would be reborn as CoffeeDrinkers.org.  Old posts will slowly be returned to their former glory, and new content will once again flow like fine espresso.

If you are an old reader of Brotherhood of the Bean, welcome back.  If you are a new reader, welcome friend.
