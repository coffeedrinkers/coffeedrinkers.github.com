You had to know it was coming, it was just a matter of when.  In case you haven’t heard, Starbuck’s has released an instant version of their coffee.  I know that I was a little skeptical, but it really does taste like a fresh brewed cup of coffee from a Starbuck’s store.  

I’m in the Army right now and our coffee from the mess hall is, well, bad.  My wife sent me some of the VIA and I’ve made it several times.  It’s really good.  Anywhere you can get hot water(or cold, depending on your tastes) you can make a cup of Starbuck’c coffee.  

I’m not always a fan of the big corporate coffee houses, but they definitely have a winner with this.  Unfortunately, it’s not available everywhere.  Looks like from their site, it’s only available in stores in Chicago, Seattle and London.  It is available online however, which I guess makes it available just about anywhere.  Good job Starbucks.
