Nothing beats away the winter chill than a warm crackling fire in the fireplace. You casually grab a log of coffee and throw it on the fire. Its warm … wait, log of coffee?

Seems odd to consider, but java-log.com has been selling condensed logs of used coffee grounds since 1998. According to Rod Sprules, the inventor of the Java-Log, the condensed Java-Logs:

    Better/Brighter Flames - more natural flame from coffee than other manufactured firelogs; Coffee has about 25% more energy than wood and triple the flame per unit of energy

    Better Scent - a faint sweet aroma, but most importantly it has “NO CHEMICAL SMELL” associated with other manufactured logs

    Clean burning - Java-logs produce significantly fewer emissions than firewood:

        96% less residue after combustion
        85% less carbon monoxide
        86% less creosote deposits
        31% less particulate matter

    Easy to light - With just one match you can light both sides of the product paper, then sit back and watch your fire grow.

    Better for the environment - less landfill waste, saves trees

    Better for your chimney - Naturally made with substantially less wax than wood-based fire-logs, Java-Logs produce significantly less soot build-up than wood.

    Burns 2-3 Hours - the same amount of time as other firelogs of the same size.

Coffee it would seem can keep us warm in more ways than one. I plan on buying some of these logs for an upcoming camping trip. A more detailed review will follow. Thank you gradin.com for bringing java-log.com to my attention!
