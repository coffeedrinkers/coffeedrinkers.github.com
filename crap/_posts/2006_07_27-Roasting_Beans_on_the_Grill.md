Yesterday I received my first shipment of unroasted coffee beans from Sweet Maria’s and was very excited to get roasting. Not having a roaster, I decided that I would try the pan roasting method, so I went and got an old skillet I use for camping, fired up the grill, and started warming up the skillet. The skillet is one of those really heavy pans, so I wanted to get it warmed up before adding the beans.

Now mind you, I’ve never done this before, but the internet has been a great resource and I found out some of the basics of roasting:

    Beans should be roasted somewhere in the neighborhood of 350-500 degrees
    Beans should not be left sitting in the pan. Keep them moving so they don’t burn.
    Decide ahead of time, what kind of roast you want, which will determine how long to roast them.
    Cool them down quickly since they’ll keep roasting after they’re off the fire.

So after 10 minutes of warming the skillet, I threw some beans in the pan (one even layer across the bottom of the pan) and got to work. Using my thermometer, I found that Ibeans-004.jpg wasn’t getting enough heat from the grill with an open lid, so I closed the lid for a minute or two, opened it up and stirred the beans, and closed it again.

I kept up this process for about 13 minutes, which was about 3 minutes after the first crack.

After the grill, I put them in a colander to cool and to get the remaining husks off.

Later that evening, I used the AeroPress to brew a couple cups of coffee and was really impressed how good the coffee was. Granted it’s not rocket science, but it was my first time, and I didn’t follow the first two guidelines I mentioned above while roasting.

I think next time, I’ll try roasting the beans a little longer and do it over the stove in a more temperature controlled environment. This was a good learning experience and I urge you to comment on the different ways you’ve roasted beans.
