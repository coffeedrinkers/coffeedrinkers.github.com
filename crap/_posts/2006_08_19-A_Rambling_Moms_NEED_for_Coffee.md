I did not drink coffee in high school. I started to drink pseudo-coffee in college. General Foods International Coffee was my induction to the coffee world while diet soda (of any kind) remained my all-nighter choice for caffeine. It wasn’t until I got my first job in the Windy City that I discovered cappuccinos, lattes and, of course, the occasional, regular cup of joe.

When I became a mother in 2001, I discovered the NEED for coffee. Around-the-clock feedings seemed to drive the need and trying to keep up with an energetic (insert age here) made it the first thing I reached for in the morning. The more active our son got, the more coffee I needed to keep up. It was amazing the difference I felt after that first cup in the morning – the things I could accomplish. I could do five loads of laundry and play hide-and-go-seek followed by a couple of rounds of Candyland. Amazing!

I have to say that it was almost an enlightening of sorts. I suddenly understood why my father didn’t want to talk in the morning before his first cup of coffee. Why my mother- and father-in-law had the coffee pot full during all hours of the day. Why my grandmother made homemade ice cream from all leftover coffee as not to waste the precious liquid. The connection between children and the need for caffeine existed long before Starbucks and my beloved latte.

So this contemplation of the connection of children and coffee brings me to a song that I only recently learned about through yet another caffeinated mother. From Ralph's World CD #2: "At the Bottom of the Sea" is The Coffee Song (see lyrics below). Since I am now on a quest for children’s music that is not too annoying to play in my grocery-getter Grand Caravan, I must add Ralph Covert to my list. A folksy Chicago pop-rocker who lyrics “are changed for the ears of the innocent” has recently joined my play list for the road and he says it best: “M-O-M-M-Y needs C-O-F-F-E-E”.

    M-O-M-M-Y needs C-O-F-F-E-E
    D-A-D-D-Y needs C-O-F-F-E-E

    I love my kid… I love my kid
    Gosh, I need love my kid
    But I need what I need, and
    I need a lot of what I need  C-O-F-F-E-E

    M-O-M-M-Y needs C-O-F-F-E-E
    D-A-D-D-Y needs C-O-F-F-E-E
    I want a latte, a cappuccino
    And tonight I think I’ll have a little vino

    M-O-M-M-Y needs C-O-F-F-E-E
    D-A-D-D-Y needs C-O-F-F-E-E
