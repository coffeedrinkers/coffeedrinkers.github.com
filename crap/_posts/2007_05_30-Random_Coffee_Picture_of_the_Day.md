Some pictures work well in color, and others really shine in black and white. This photo, appropriately titled “the last drop” is such a picture that benefits, and is enhanced in my opinion from its use of black and white.

I really find myself enjoying a number of elements in this photo — the reflection of the cup, the sharply contrasting lines of the grate, and of course the droplet caught mid air.

Mivella has some great photos on her Flickr photostream, I highly encourage everyone to take a few minutes to explore her work.
