Decadent? Yes… Cool? Absolutely… While I have not had the opportunity to review this product, I could not resist bringing it to your attention.  As a person who has many times had to scramble to find a spoon for my coffee…

Say goodbye to your spoon, from the minds of Hammacher Schlemmer comes the Self-Stirring Mug!

A small propeller at the bottom of this mug running at a cool 3,000 rpms will mix whatever liquid you choose to drink on command.

The mug even includes a lid to prevent spilling and retain heat. And in a pinch the lid can be used as a coaster.

At $29.95, make no mistake, this is as decadent as it gets. If anyone has used one of these mugs I would love to hear about it, I just can't bring myself to buy one for review.
