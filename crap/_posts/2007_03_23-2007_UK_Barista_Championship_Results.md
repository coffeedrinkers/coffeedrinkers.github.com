On behalf of everyone at Brotherhood of the Bean we would like to congratulate James Hoffmann over at jimseven.com!

Jim was the UK Barista Champion in 2006, he bean all other competitors this year with a final score of 721. (Jim pictured center)

Second place went to Se Gorman (691.5) an third place went to Ed Buston (683.5). For those not familiar with the UK Barista Championships, it is a 45 minute times competition (15 minutes prep, 15 minutes competition, 15 minutes cleanup).

During the 15 minute competition portion the barista must make:

    Four identical single espresso’s
    Four identical cappuccino’s
    Four identical espresso-based alcohol free signature beverages of their own creation

These competitors are coffee artisans of the highest caliber. Its pretty safe to assume that even their worst espresso pull or coffee creation would be the best coffee/coffee experience you have ever had in your life.

I’ve been a frequent reader of Jim’s Blog, while we may consider ourselves coffee aficionado’s, fervent lovers of coffee in all its forms — Jim is a virtuoso of coffee, a true artist in every sense of the word.

Jim has an excellent writeup about his performance in the competition, I highly recommend you give it a read when you have the time!
