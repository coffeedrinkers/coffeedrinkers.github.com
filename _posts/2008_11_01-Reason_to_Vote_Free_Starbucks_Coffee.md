It’s hard to believe that the Presidential election is just around the corner, at this point its at our doorstep. Tuesday, a day for history whichever way the vote ends up going.

During the latest Saturday Night Live, Starbucks did its best to tempt people get off their asses and vote on Tuesday with a simple message delivered in the soothing Starbucks colors:

    “What if we all cared enough to vote?”

The better question is “Why don’t we all care enough to vote?” . Its something I have never understood, the apathy that so many people have for something so simple, yet so radically important. But that’s a question for another time.

The message ends with an offer —

    “If you care enough to vote, we care enough to give you a free cup of coffee. You and Starbucks. It’s bigger than coffee.”

So there you have it, vote Tuesday and get some free drip coffee from Starbucks. As far as I can tell its an honor system, so I imagine some people will lie to just get some free coffee. But I imagine a certain percentage of people will go out and vote because of this offer of free coffee.
