Tired of wondering where else you can go for caffeine other than Starbucks or Caribou?  Check this out:

Simply go the website, type in your zip and it gives you a list of independant coffee shops in your area.  And if you know of one not listed, you can add it.  Thereâ€™s also a link for use with your cell phone!

Pretty cool little site.  I used it and found a number of places I had no idea existed.  For those die hard Starbucks fans (why are you reading this anyway?) they also list local Starbucks.
