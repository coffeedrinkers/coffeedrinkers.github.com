Fresh off my rant about the loss of culture in coffee houses, I decided to finally stop in a relatively new coffee house that I just had yet to visit.

Nestled in an unassuming strip mall, the Green Leaf Coffee House was my destination this last Friday after work. I didn't know what the experience would be like. But I approached it with an open mind and a hopeful heart.

Even before I opened the door my heart began to beat faster — there on the glass was a calendar… Open Mic nights, Poetry readings, Live music, Chess & Book club and a menagerie of other events!

As I opened the door I was buffeted by the deep and rich smell of coffee. A pair of angel headed hipsters sat at the counter casually drinking their coffee of choice. A friendly face and warm smile greeted me, this was not the face of a corporate barista whose smile seems more a part of corporate doctrine than genuine sincerity. This was a barista genuinely happy to see a customer and take an order.

As I soaked in the warm cream and coffee colored tones adorning the walls, the inviting leather couches, and the chess set just waiting to be played, my eyes came to rest on the menu on the wall. I don't know why, but I am a sucker for chalk — It tells me that change happens, and there is a possibility that on my next visit, I might see something new.

I was soon to learn that the woman serving me was one of the owners, I complimented her on the fine job they had done and proceeded to order a cappuccino and went to take a seat at the couch in the back of the store.

My cappuccino arrived in a massive ceramic cup, the foam was perfection, and the smell tantalizing. As I sipped the cappuccino and relaxed in the couch, the quiet murmur of conversations provide a gentle background hum that seemed to make my enjoyment of the cappuccino even greater.

As my cup slowly emptied, I knew my time at the coffee house was coming to an end. I smiled to the owner as I left knowing a return was in my future. If you find yourself in Aurora, IL — Please stop in the Green Leaf Coffee House for a cup of coffee or tea, it will not disappoint.
