… And a collective gasp was heard across the Blogsphere…

Can it be true, did he just say… Yes friends, tonight I curse the very Coffee I love. And why you may ask?

Hot Cinnamon Espresso - Two shots of Espresso, one scoop of Cinnamon Ice Cream, Whole Milk and Whipped Cream topped off with more Cinnamon sprinkles… Dee-Lish!

Sitting behind the counter was a brand spanking new Franke Evolution 1-Step Espresso Machine. Now I had heard of this maker, but never seen one in person.
