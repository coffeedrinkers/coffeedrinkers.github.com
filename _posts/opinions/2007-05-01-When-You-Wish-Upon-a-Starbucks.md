I recently visited Disney World in Orlando, FL for a fun-filled family vacation. There were two things I assumed they would have outside of the global knowns; good coffee and free Internet access.

Disney Coffee CupYou know what they say about people that assume? I’m sure you do. Walt Disney apparently doesn’t drink coffee, because the dirty water they serve up at the Disney resorts is crap.

And I might have been okay with that - okay with the fact that a Disney-class resort doesn’t have good coffee in your room, nor in the main eating establishment(s) - except that there was no good coffee to be found anywhere.

Granted, I didn’t leave the Disney World to explore Orlando, which I’m sure has good coffee…somewhere. I even hit Ghirardelli hoping they’d have a decent cup of black Jo. Nada.

So if you’re headed to the greatest piece of manufactured tourism in the world anytime soon, don’t forget to pack some coffee. You don’t want to be decaffeinated at that place!
