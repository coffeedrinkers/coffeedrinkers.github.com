If your office is like mine, you no doubt have had an buildup of coffee talk over the last few weeks concerning the election tomorrow.  That is a good thing, and coffee is an excellent catalyst for discussion as we all know.  To that end I just wanted to remind everyone to vote tomorrow.

Frankly, if you don’t vote — you have no right to complain when things are in the crapper.  To that end, I just wanted to give everyone a link to an Election Protection website that has information about what is needed to vote in your state.  Take a minute to look at this site, I’d hate to see anyone turned away who should be able to vote.  See you at the polls!
