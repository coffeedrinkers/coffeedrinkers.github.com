![Coffee Cookbook](/images/coffee_book1.gif){: .pull-right}We drink coffee, and we add it to chocolate and other confectionery delights — but I have to wonder, what else could it do for the cooking world? The other day I ran across an interesting recipe on Emma’s Kitchen entitled - Coffee Barbecue Chicken, and as I read over the ingredient list:

* 6 chicken legs, thighs and drumsticks separated
* 1 teaspoon oil
* 1/2 onion, chopped
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1/4 cup strong coffee
* 1 teaspoon mustard powder
* 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* salt and freshly ground pepper

I just found my mouth watering at the thought of combining coffee with garlic, pepper and mustard. This really got me thinking about a potentially untapped area of coffee appreciation that I had yet to explore — Cooking with Coffee.

A casual foray onto [www.cdkitchen.com](http://www.cdkitchen.com) yielded a number of savory coffee related recipes, including — Coffee Roast Beef. Delving into the Aabree Coffee Company site, I found a recipe for Pepper Coffee Barbecue (Surf & Turf - Image at top of this article!). If you have a favorite recipe (non-dessert) that uses coffee, please consider sharing it with us in the comment section below.

The Global Exchange Fair Trade online store even sells a book entitled — Cooking With Coffee: 60 Recipes Using Fair Trade Coffee. As a staunch supporter of Fair Trade Coffee, Brotherhood of the Bean welcomes any and every effort to aid in the Fair Trade Coffee Cause.

I never would have thought when I stumbled across Emma’s Kitchen that I would find a coffee recipe on it for something other than a dessert item. That visit has made me aware of a whole new world of coffee cooking opportunities which I look forward to exploring and sharing with you in the very near future. We hope you will do the same!
