![Coffee House Culture Image](/images/Jrb002_thumb.jpg){: .pull-right}Coffee houses have served as cultural gathering grounds since coffee has been sold. Men, women, artists, poets, political activists and almost every other social group have used coffee houses as a catalyst which provides the spark of imagination and debate.

Why then do I feel like an essential part of our social collective is slowly being burned into oblivion one corporate coffee shop at a time? I really don't care if Starbucks charges $1, $4, or even $10 for a cup of coffee.

What concerns me is the cultural apathy that is growing within so many coffee shops today. I can't remember the last time I went for a cup of coffee and heard someone reading poetry, or playing an instrument, or having a group discussion. Instead my memories seem sanitized and devoid of culture beyond the cup of coffee I was ordering.

There can be little debate that the revitalization of culture within the coffee houses we frequent will require our direct efforts. So here is my challenge to you â€” find a way to facilitate a cultural rebirth at your favourite coffee shop.

Figure out a way to get a group of strangers together to sit down, have some coffee and discus a topic. There are many options available, all that it takes is a conscious decision on your part to make it happen, and it will.

Share with us your successes and failures, a wise person once said:
