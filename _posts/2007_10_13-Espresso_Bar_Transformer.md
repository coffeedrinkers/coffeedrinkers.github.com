There is a transformer in New York City’s Columbus Circe. Its more than meets the eye. It looks like an unassuming shipping container — All that adorns it is an a sign that says “Illy”. But watch closely and you just might get to see it transform into an espresso bar.

From November 28th to December 29th this unique espresso bar will be available for your viewing and tasting enjoyment. Serving the Illy take on the pod coffee system, a free espresso will be yours for the taking if you stop by to see Illy’s take on Adam Kalkin’s “Quik House”.

Who is Adam Kalkin? A noted architect whose contemporary designs turn conventional shipping containers into usable living space.  Normally the “Quik House” has three bedrooms and two and a half baths with a 2,000 square foot floor plan.  The shell just takes a single day to put together, from start to finish the entire building can be completed in two to three months.

I have to hand it to Illy for coming up with unique and functional marketing idea.  This really comes as no surprise to me given Illy’s unique vision of what a coffee house should resemble.  Just take a look at the Illy website and its clear that they offer an uniquely European view of coffee and espresso.

While I have never had the opportunity to try their pod coffee, I have tried their traditional coffee offerings and have enjoyed them immensely.  Its times like this that I wish I had a travel budget so I could fly out and see this concept coffee bar.  If you are a Brotherhood of the Bean reader in New York City, I hope you will go to Columbus Circle in November and post your review.
