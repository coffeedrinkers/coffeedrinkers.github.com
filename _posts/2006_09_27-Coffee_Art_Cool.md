I thought I might show you some Coffee Art I recently bought from the Home Interiors Better Homes & Gardens Collection.

For a long time we struggled with what kind of art to get for our kitchen. When we saw this trio of coffee themed pictures we knew we just had to have them.

While not readily evident from my rank amateur photo attempt, these pictures are actually a canvas bound with push pins similar to those you might see on a leather chair, and mounted on top of the black wood backboard.
