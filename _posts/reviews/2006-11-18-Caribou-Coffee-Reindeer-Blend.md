![Caribou Coffee Reindeer Blend](/images/caribou.gif){: .pull-right}Normally I am not a fan of Caribou Coffee. When I say that most people I know think I am insane. To them, the faux wood lodge interior and carmel infused drinks makes them yearn for a rustic land far from the burbs of Chicago.

Caribou Coffee tries hard to be the anti-Starbucks. The Eddie Bauer to the Starbucks Abercrombie & Fitch.

That being the case, I tend to avoid Caribou as much as I avoid Starbucks. However, a few days ago I awoke to find a small package of Caribou Coffee Reindeer Blend on my kitchen counter — a surprise from my wife.

**As I read the label — Heavy - Spicy - Caramely**

Mixed emotions filled me — on one hand I was touched that my wife had brought me this unexpected coffee gift — on the other hand, it was Caribou coffee.

But I decided in the spirit of the upcoming Christmas season that I would keep an open mind and see what exactly this blend would bring to the table.

As the label promises, this blend actually does have a hint of spice in its aroma. This smell isn’t revealed until it is brewed, to me it has a slightly orange and cinnamon smell to it, almost like mulled spice.

![Caribou Coffee Reindeer Blend](/images/c_deer.jpg){: .pull-left}The “caramely” claim on the package no doubt comes from the longer roasting time used on this blends coffee beans. Longer roasting times cause a sugar caramelization to occur inside the beans.

I have always found such a roasting plan to give the coffee beans more of a burnt taste, but some people seem to enjoy the longer roast times.

That being said, this coffee is not overly acidic, has a great aroma (woke my wife up from a sound sleep), and does have hints of spices. If you are looking for a holiday blend, this is definitely an option.
