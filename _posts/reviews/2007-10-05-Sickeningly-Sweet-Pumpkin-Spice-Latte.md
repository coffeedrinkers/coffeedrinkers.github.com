![Pumpkin Spice Latte](/images/panera-latte.png){: .pull-right}It all started with bagels. My co-workers and I were hunger and just not up for another cup of what our company calls coffee. Its not surprising that it didn’t take much arm twisting before we were on our way to Panera.

Walking into the store my thoughts quite honestly were on the Asiago cheese bagel that I would soon be eating. The aroma of coffee hit me almost immediately and my eyes were drawn up to the list of Coffee related items for sale.

As luck would have it, a new coffee drink was available — the Pumpkin Spice Latte. It sounded interesting and I was in an autumnal mood, so I ordered one to go.

**So how did it taste?**

It tasted like a combination of mulling spices, caramel and sugar. Notice I didn’t mention anything about having a coffee taste, that is because any trace coffee tastes were gone.

The espresso flavor was obliterated by pumpkin syrup, corn syrup, molasses, spices, spice mix (water, evaporated cane juice crystals, natural flavors, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, xanthan gum, citric acid, clove, gellan gum), caramel syrup and vanilla extract among other things.

Now I understand the point of these speciality drinks is to emphasis the special characteristics it is trying to embody, but this may be the first time I have had a drink that eliminates the coffee flavor all together.

Weighing in at 410 calories, with 90 of those coming from fat, this will not be a drink I will be having again. If you don’t like the taste of coffee, this very well may be the drink for you.
