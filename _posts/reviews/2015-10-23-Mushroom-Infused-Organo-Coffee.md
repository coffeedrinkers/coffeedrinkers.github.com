![Organo Coffee](/images/organo.png){: .pull-right}I would say that I am fairly adventurous when it comes to coffee.  In the past I've tried coffee pre-processed by small mammals ([Kopi Luwak](http://www.coffeedrinkers.org/reviews/Taking-it-to-the-Extreme-Kopi-Luwak/)), and I've gone to the polar opposite and tried a coffee substitute made for people for whom decaf is just not decaf enough.  So as you might imagine, trying a mushroom infused coffee is well within my comfort zone.

If you have never heard of Organo coffee before, it is a brand of coffee whose global ambassador is none other than the golf legend Greg Norman.  Organo coffee is different from other brands of coffee in that it is infused with pure Ganoderma lucidum (aka reishi mushrooms).

I have my wife to thank for the opportunity to try Organo coffee. My wife Karin is a village trustee for the town we live in (Oswego, IL) and as a result, she talks to a lot of people.  As a naturally friendly and chatty person, she is Leslie Knope to my Ron Swanson.

A few weeks ago she was chatting with Jaratio Tucker whose son goes to school with our son Maverick.  It was then that she learned that Jaratio is a distributor for Organo Gold.  Naturally my wife told him about this site and before I knew it there was a knock on my door from Jaratio with some Organo Gold samples for me to try.

Initially I had no clue that this coffee was infused with anything, I'll admit I didn't read the box, I didn't look at the website, I just put the coffee in the kitchen.  In retrospect this might have been the best possible thing to happen because I went into trying this coffee without no preconceived notions.

There were two types of Organo coffee that I was given to sample --  
**Black Gold Brew Cups** & **Cafe Supreme**.

**Black Gold Brew Cups**

Designed for Keurig and compatible single serve brewing solutions, the Black Gold brew cups from Organo contain arabica coffee and organic Ganoderma lucidum powder.  If I had to describe my initial impression after the first sip, I would say the word I would use would be **earthy**.  

Which surprisingly is what I though the first time I tried Kopi Luwak which is some of the most expensive coffee in the world.  Bear in mind, I had no idea at this point that it contained mushroom powder.  

Arabica coffee is as a general rule, more mellow and for lack of better term, smooth than say robusta. I would imagine that this allows the Ganoderma lucidum to have more of an affect on the taste that it would with robusta beans.  The effect I found pleasant and while slightly different that I was expecting, enjoyable.

**Cafe Supreme**

Packaged in single serve packets, Cafe Supreme is a very fine powdered coffee drink mix that is brewed in the cup (no filter required).  In addition to Ganoderma lucidum, this coffee product also include Ginseng.  

Like the Black Gold brew cups when brewed I could notice a hint of an earthy flavor, slightly less pronounced.  To be honest, I didn't notice the ginseng but I might just need to buy some to see if now that I know ginseng is in the mix, if I can detect it.

Overall I found both products to be enjoyable.  I'd honestly put them both solidly in the mid to mid/upper tier of coffee I have tried.  What may elevate this coffee for some people could be the supposed medicinal benefits from Ganoderma lucidum.

**Shrooms man! Shrooms!**

Is there a health benefit to adding Ganoderma lucidum to their coffee? Like many herbal suppliments there are many people who swear by it.  Scientifically speaking, testing continues.  I won't say its good for you, I won't say it's bad.  I honestly don't know. 

If you want to do some research on your own, I ran across a fairly comprehensive article that focuses in on actual scientific study results over at Supplement Geek located [here](http://supplement-geek.com/ganoderma-benefits-review-side-effects/).  

I'd recommend you read the Supplement Geek post, do some additional research and of course, talk to your doctor first before adding this to your diet **if** you are in poor health to start with.  Don't take risks, don't make assumptions.

I'd like to thank Mr. Jaratio Tucker for giving me this opportunity to sample some of Organo's offerings.  If you would like more information about Organo please do not hesitate to contact him at jaratio.tucker@gmail.com.
