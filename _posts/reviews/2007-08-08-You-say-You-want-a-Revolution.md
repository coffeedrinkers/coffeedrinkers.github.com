![Mug Revolution](/images/1054319909_e73501f65f.jpg){: .pull-right}Well, I know… we all want to change the world. And if Owen Dearing over at Mug Revolution has anything to do say about it he will lead the revolution from boring small coffee cups, to hand made stoneware that holds more coffee, looks better, and lasts longer.

With meat hooks like mine I really appreciated the hearty handle. And just looks at the mouth on this cup! I can literally put my balled up fist inside!

And just look at the colors! An absolutely amazing look, feel and finish to these mugs. I have to be honest with you, I have yet to use another mug since reviewing these. One of my biggest coffee annoyances are small cups. Half the time it seems like the cup is empty after three or four sips. Not so with these babies.

If you are in the market for some great mugs, head over to Mug Revolution today. You will not be disappointed.
