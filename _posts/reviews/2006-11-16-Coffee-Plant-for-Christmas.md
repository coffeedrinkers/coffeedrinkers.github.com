![Coffee Plant](/images/tree.jpg){: .pull-right}Looking to buy your favorite coffee lover something unique this year? Does the thought of trying to find another unique coffee mug make you want to scream?

How about getting them something unique, that most coffee lovers have never actually seen —
A Live Coffee Plant!

Yes, for as little as eight dollars plus shipping and handling you can have a live coffee plant delivered to your door.

![Gurney](/images/gurneys.jpg){: .pull-left}According to Gurney’s, these coffee plants will grow up to four feet in height. And like the real coffee plant that they are, they will flower and bear actual coffee beans, which tells me that it is an Arabica plant (Robustica requires cross-pollination — I’m not a coffee geek, really I’m not!).

Just click [here](http://gurneys.com/product.asp_Q_pn_E_11295) to visit Gurney’s and order a live coffee plant today!
