![Puro Scuro Blend](/images/blend_puroscuro.jpg){: .pull-right}Three days ago I received my latest shipment of green coffee from sweetmarias.com. Six pounds of various blends and straight lots. I was almost completely out of coffee, except for a little ground Starbucks we keep around for emergencies, so I started roasting right away. 

The first batch I did was the Puro Scuro blend. I’m not going to go into great detail trying to write details about the nuances of the coffee, you can check that out [here](https://legacy.sweetmarias.com/library/content/new-arrivals-sweet-marias-puro-scuro-blend-honduras-organic-marcala-cocosam-coopcosta-rica-l).

I was very happy with this coffee. I roasted it probably between the first and second crack and it turned out very well, although I may go a little longer next time. It’s a good strong taste, with hints of various different flavors like chocolate as well as other flavors I couldn’t quite put my finger on. What ever it is, Sweet Maria’s did a great job with this blend.

I picked this blend randomly, just to try something different, but this already a favorite in our house. Just a note, as probably with all coffee, this tasted much better from a French Press and Aerobie, than from a drip coffee pot.
