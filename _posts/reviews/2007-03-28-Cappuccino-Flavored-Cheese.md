Well this certainly is a unique pairing of coffee. From our friends across the pond comes Cappuccino flavored cheese. The Islington Gazette reports that Morrisons in the Nag’s Head, Holloway Road, Holloway is selling for a limited time cappuccino flavored cheese.

The cheese which is marketed as an “after-dinner delicacy” appears to be getting mixed reviews. I personally think they get high marks for creativity (the cheese is two toned to look like cappuccino), and effort.

If any of our UK readers would care to try this cheese and give a review, it would be warmly welcomed. The cheese will be available for limited time.
