Coffee, Espresso, Latte… all things that are perfection by themselves, but when combined with other treats, become absolutely sinful…

So let me tell you about something sinfully delicious. These products require a bit of cooking, but they are so simple, tastefully simple if you will, that even a lowly man like myself can make.

Absolutely Almost Pound cake takes a healthy (or unhealthy) portion of butter and infuses it with almond and bundles it up into a moist, dense pound cake. I especially like this product because its a great compliment to coffee and is a nice step up from biscotti.

Nana’s Apple cake has an old world charm that like its name suggests, reminds me of something a grandmother would make. Its earthy goodness is reminiscent to a time when pies were left on window sills to cool down. If apples are your thing, I would suggest you try this mix.

Both of these products are sold by a company called Tastefully Simple through independent consultants or directly from their corporate site.

If you are interested in helping out with a cause, my wife recently started selling these products to help pay for our international adoption from China. By following the link below, you can order these products for the same price as you normally would but my wife will receive a commission that will be put towards our adoption costs.

Whether you follow the link above to my wife’s consultant page, or just go to the site directly we are confident that you will enjoy either of these products with your coffee of choice.
