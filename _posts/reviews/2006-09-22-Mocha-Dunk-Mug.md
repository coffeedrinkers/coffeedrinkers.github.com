![Aerobie AeroPress](/images/mocha-dunk-mug.jpg){: .pull-right}Feeling better, I found myself reading a review by Arieanna on Cooking Gadgets about a unique coffee cup that caters to the sweet tooth in all of us.

Part coffee cup, part cookie plate, the Mocha Dunk Mug from Charles & Marie adds a convenient storage location for your favorite cookies or biscotti.

By widening one side of the cup, dunking cookies and other wider confectionery delights becomes is done with ease and elegance.

If you have had an opportunity to try one of these cups or something similar, we would love to hear about your experience with it.
