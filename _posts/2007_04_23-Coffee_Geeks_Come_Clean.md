It was inevitable that someone, in the grand search for a faster way to wake up in the morning would pair up our beloved caffeine with the most unlikely of allies — SOAP.

Enter ThinkGeek.com, innovators, inventors, geeks.. A site the inner boy in every man loves, and the bane of girlfriends and wives the world over (yes dear, another gizmo).

But don’t take my word for it friends, listen to what the fine folks over at ThinkGeek.com have to say about Shower Shock Soap:

    “Shower Shock is an all vegetable based glycerine soap which does not contain any harsh ingredients like ethanol, diethanolamine, polyethylene glycol or cocyl isethionate. So it’s a gently invigorating soap — Scented with peppermint oil and infused with caffeine anhydrous, each bar of Shower shock contains approximately 12 servings/showers per 4 ounce bar with 200 milligrams of caffeine per serving. No, we’re not kidding and no you don’t eat it. The caffeine is absorbed through the skin…

    Have smelly co-workers that sleep in too much? Give them the gift of Shower Shock…”

So why then should you care about this soap when you have coffee you can enjoy? If you have taken the time to actually set your timer to start brewing at 6AM, congratulations, I am envious.

If you are like me who regularly forgets set his coffeemaker, doesn’t get enough sleep, or is awoken by either a rambunctious 5 year old or a crabby 14 year old cat — getting up in the morning is like raising the dead. I stumble into the shower and curse myself for not setting the damn coffee maker.

A little caffeine in the soap would make the world seem right again and put me in a better mood when I do go downstairs to make the coffee. Its either that or move the coffee pot into my bathroom… Now there is an idea worthy of consideration!
