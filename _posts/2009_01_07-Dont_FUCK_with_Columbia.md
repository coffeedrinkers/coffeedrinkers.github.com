Columbia has a lot going against it.  Massive drug cartels, rampant violent, poverty, etc.   It’s one shining light of goodness is it’s coffee trade — and nothing personifies that trade like Juan Valdez.

Everyone knows him, we grew up on his commercials felt a kinship with him, his donkey and his sack of coffee beans.  In Columbia he is an icon, and when that icon is messed with, Columbia’s claws come out.

mother-goose-juan-valdezMike Peter’s has found himself on the receiving end of a lawsuit over his cartoon (above) that lampoons good old Juan Valdez.  According to a report from the Associated Press:

    The Colombian Coffee Growers Federation says it will sue “Mother Goose & Grimm” cartoonist Mike Peters “for damage and harm, detriment to intellectual property and defamation.”

Damages which add up to heft $20 million dollars.  Peters was quoted as saying:

    Peters told the AP Wednesday he loves Colombian coffee and did not intend any offense.

All I have to say is “Yikes!”  and I’d like to point out how much we love Juan Valdez.
