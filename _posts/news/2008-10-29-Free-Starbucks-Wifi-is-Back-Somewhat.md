You might recall all the hubbub and gashing of teeth from the hordes of iPhone users when Starbucks nixed the planned free wifi.  It looked then like the iPhone contingent would never be able to look elite surfing their lattes and looking cool on their iPhone.

The villain in the situation isn’t even the company that caused the access to be removed (T-Mobile).  The villain is Starbucks who failed to honor the exclusive contract that they had with T-Mobile.  Contracts! We don’t need no stinkin’ contracts.

The kicker is that the access is only available at U.S. Company owned Starbucks.  That equates to roughly 40% of all the Starbucks in existence.  Not the greatest odds, but better than before for sure.  So, what would this news mean for me?

Well nothing since I don’t have an iPhone, but in the interest of coffee I popped over to the Starbucks Wifi Locator Service and pulled up the store locations for my zip code that have wifi.   Bear in mind, that there are three Starbucks within 2000 yards of each other outside of my subdivision.

The results — “No Stores Found”.  Ah well.
