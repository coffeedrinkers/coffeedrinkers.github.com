![Krispy Kreme](/images/kk-d.png){: .pull-right}I was reading on Franchise International that Krispy Kreme is going to be expanding its operations into the Middle East.

The first outlet will open in Deira, UAE in a bid to compete with the already established Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks.

Very soon will the neon glow announce when hot donuts are available.

Krispy Creme is quick to point on that they also serve coffee, and this too will be made available to the Middle East.  Frankly Krispy Kreme could give me dirty dishwater and tell me its a fine Kona blend and I wouldnâ€™t notice as I consumed the fat and sugar laden goodness of their donuts.

My theory is that Krispy Kreme could be the catalyst needed to finally bring peace to the Middle East.  When tensions begin to rise, Krispy Kreme donuts can be used to defuse the situation.

When people want to riot, imagine how the riots could be cut short once people saw the glowing red sign.. Why fight when you can eat free donuts?  Ah, if it were only that simple!
