Ok, regardless of whether you’re in favor of the current military conflicts we’re involved in, everyone should be behind our troops. They have left the comforts of their homes to serve as their country needs them. Here’s a way we can bring one of the comforts of home to them.

Coffee for our troops is a website that will let you purchase anywhere from a bag to several cases and have it sent to a servicemember overseas.

For those of you that would like to do more than hang a magnetic ribbon on your car, this would be a great way to express your support.
