![Reporter](/images/reporter.jpg){: .pull-right}I was pleasantly surprised to see on p.86 of the Sept 18th issue of TIME® a cursory review of the Aerobie Aeropress, and a honorable mention of the i-Roast 2. While not what I would exactly call “new” products, these are two fantastic products.

If you are new to Brotherhood of the Bean, you may not have had the opportunity to read our earlier reviews of the Aerobie Aeropress (July), or the i-Roast 2 (June). Some products are worthy of a second look.
