While we enjoy talking about coffee, like you, we enjoy drinking it even more. That being said, we cordially invite our Chicagoland readers to join us for a free cup of coffee, cappuccino or espresso on October 15th.

From 10AM - 3PM we will be serving complimentary coffee at the “Home for the Holidays” Craft and Home event in Oswego, IL.

In the Spirit of Giving — Individuals who bring non-perishable food items for donation to local charities will receive free raffle tickets for a variety of door prizes.

A variety of local artisans and vendors will be on hand to assist you with your Holiday shopping needs. For a more detailed list of vendors, directions and contact information, click on the image below.
